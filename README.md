# Anomaly Detection - Credit Card Dataset

This repository contains code for anomaly detection using the Credit Card Dataset. Anomaly detection is crucial for identifying rare events or outliers that can have great significance but are harder to find with traditional methods.

## Dataset

The Credit Card Dataset used in this project is sourced from [mention source/website if applicable].

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Directory to store the dataset (not included in this repo).
- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for anomaly detection algorithms.
  - `anomaly_detection.py`: Main script for detecting anomalies in the dataset.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions used in anomaly detection.
- **`results/`**: Folder to store results and outputs generated by the scripts.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/anomaly-detection-credit-card.git
   cd anomaly-detection-credit-card
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all required libraries are installed.

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Anomaly Detection**:

   ```
   python src/anomaly_detection.py
   ```

   This will run the anomaly detection algorithm on the credit card dataset and output the results in the `results/` directory.
